Stack size
- value of your chips

effective stack size
- how many chips you can lose in a hand (depending on bet/raise order)
- this can determine how you decide to play your hand (equivalent hands)

playing styles:
- tight aggressive (TAG, bet often, call seldom) - recommended
- loose aggressive (LAG, bet often, call often) - could win
- tight passive (TP/Weak, bet seldom, call seldom) - not optimal
- loose passive (calling machine, bet seldom, call often) - cannot win


M Ratio: effective stack / (sum of blinds and antes)
% of your stack that is the blinds and antes
- how many rounds can you survive if you fold every time
- how important the blinds are to your stack
- lower M means blinds matter more - do what you can to win the blinds in those cases

Q Ratio: stack size / (sum of all stack sizes at table)
- not as useful, but you know your standing

Effective M: M * (#players/10)
- also not really that useful
