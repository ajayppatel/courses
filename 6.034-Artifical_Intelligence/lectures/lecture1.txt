- Representations that support the making of models
- Representation exposes constraints
- This enables algorithms

- Generate and test
  - Generating possible solutions, give them to a tester, then comes failures or success
  - Tree leaf, look through book, find name of leaf
  - Generators should not be redundant and informational

- Rumpelstiltskin Principle - once you name something you get power over it

- Simple ideas can be powerful. Different than trivial
